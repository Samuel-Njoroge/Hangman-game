# How the game is played.

Hangman was one, other than some chit games, to guess words according to the guesses determined and as soon as they lost all their wrong guesses, they were hanged (not really, but on paper ðŸ˜‰)

In this Python game, the opponent is the computer and the player tries to guess the word before the time is over . Each time the player misses,  there is a line drawn that continues to join until the choice number is out and the player is 'hanged'.
